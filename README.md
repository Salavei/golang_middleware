### **Build a middleware using echo framework**

 First of all, you should create a handler which sends how many 
**days** left **until 1 Jan 2025** and response with HTTP **200 OK** status
code.

 Secondly, build a middleware, which checks HTTP header _User-Role_ presents and contains _admin_ and prints
_"red button user detected"_ to the console (using default log 
package or any 3rd party) if so.

 Think about coding standards and best practices. In general,
the task is about providing a working solution, but if you have time
to create a good code-structure, we'd love it!
